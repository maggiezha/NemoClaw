# Agent selection

Choose one CPU-only agent for the OpenShell sandbox:
[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (default and most exercised),
[Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent), or
[Deep Agents Code](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/code/overview).
Set `AGENT_NAME` to select the agent. Each uses OpenShell's
`https://inference.local/v1` proxy and the same GPU inference, HPA, and monitoring stack;
see [Agent and runtime support](README.md#agent-and-runtime-support).

Official host-installer quickstarts (this branch):
[OpenClaw](../../../docs/get-started/quickstart.mdx),
[Hermes](../../../docs/get-started/quickstart-hermes.mdx), and
[LangChain Deep Agents Code](../../../docs/get-started/quickstart-langchain-deepagents-code.mdx).
Published copies: [OpenClaw](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/user-guide/openclaw/get-started/quickstart),
[Hermes](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/user-guide/hermes/get-started/quickstart), and
[Deep Agents Code](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/user-guide/deepagents/get-started/quickstart).

This recipe does **not** use `nemoclaw` / `nemohermes` / `nemo-deepagents launch`.
Those commands are the host Docker installer path. Here the CPU agent lives in an
OpenShell Kubernetes sandbox and talks to GPU inference through
`https://inference.local/v1`. Confirm each agent with the [Recipe quick start](#recipe-quick-start).

## Recipe quick start

Run **one** of the loops below after the GPU chart and OpenShell gateway are up.
Shared prerequisites (do these once): [README Quick start](README.md#quick-start)
steps 1–3 (GPU inference + HPA), Agent Sandbox CRDs, `install-openshell-k8s.sh`,
and a live OpenShell port-forward:

```bash
kubectl -n nemoclaw-sandboxes port-forward service/openshell 8080:8080
```

Keep that port-forward attached. Use a second terminal in
`deploy/helm/gpu_autoscaling_k8s`. Source `versions.env` there. The GPU Helm
chart is agent-neutral; only the sandbox image and `AGENT_NAME` change.

Do not mix `AGENT_NAME` values in one sandbox. To try another agent, build its
image and create a **separate** sandbox name. A pass is the `OK: sandbox …`
line in [Example verify output](#example-verify-output).

Documented example one-script paths (skip the HPA load test unless `RUN_LOAD_TEST=1`):

- OpenClaw + Ollama: [`scripts/test-openclaw-ollama.sh`](scripts/test-openclaw-ollama.sh)
- Hermes + vLLM: [`scripts/test-hermes-vllm.sh`](scripts/test-hermes-vllm.sh)
- Deep Agents Code + vLLM: [`scripts/test-deepagents-vllm.sh`](scripts/test-deepagents-vllm.sh)

### OpenClaw

Matches the official [OpenClaw quickstart](../../../docs/get-started/quickstart.mdx)
harness (`openclaw tui` / `openclaw agent --agent main -m`) on this Kubernetes path.

```bash
source versions.env
export AGENT_NAME=openclaw
export AGENT_SANDBOX_IMAGE=localhost:32000/nemoclaw-${AGENT_NAME}-k8s:${NEMOCLAW_VERSION}
export INFERENCE_MODEL=llama3.2:3b   # must match the GPU chart model
./scripts/build-agent-sandbox-image.sh
./scripts/create-agent-sandbox.sh
```

Terminal 2 — keep attached (starts `/usr/local/bin/nemoclaw-start`):

```bash
export AGENT_NAME=openclaw
./scripts/run-agent-sandbox.sh
```

Terminal 3 — real headless prompt through `openclaw agent --agent main -m`:

```bash
export AGENT_NAME=openclaw
export INFERENCE_MODEL=llama3.2:3b
./scripts/verify-agent-sandbox.sh
```

One-script path for this example: [`scripts/test-openclaw-ollama.sh`](scripts/test-openclaw-ollama.sh).

### Hermes

Matches the official [Hermes quickstart](../../../docs/get-started/quickstart-hermes.mdx)
harness (`NEMOCLAW_AGENT=hermes`, `nemohermes`, in-sandbox `hermes` / `hermes -z`).
This recipe's `AGENT_NAME` is the same string (`hermes`). The host CLI
`nemohermes launch` is **not** used here: OpenShell `0.0.85` leaves the pod idle
until `run-agent-sandbox.sh` starts the gateway. Health is `:8642/health` (not
OpenClaw's `:18789/health`). This recipe does not port-forward the Hermes dashboard.

```bash
source versions.env
export AGENT_NAME=hermes
export AGENT_SANDBOX_IMAGE=localhost:32000/nemoclaw-${AGENT_NAME}-k8s:${NEMOCLAW_VERSION}
export INFERENCE_MODEL=llama3.2:3b
./scripts/build-agent-sandbox-image.sh
./scripts/create-agent-sandbox.sh
```

Terminal 2 — keep attached:

```bash
export AGENT_NAME=hermes
./scripts/run-agent-sandbox.sh
```

Terminal 3 — real headless prompt through `hermes -z`:

```bash
export AGENT_NAME=hermes
export INFERENCE_MODEL=llama3.2:3b
./scripts/verify-agent-sandbox.sh
```

The loop above uses Ollama (`llama3.2:3b`), which official docs also list for Hermes.
The popular recipe example is Hermes + vLLM: [`scripts/test-hermes-vllm.sh`](scripts/test-hermes-vllm.sh).

### Deep Agents Code

Matches the official
[LangChain Deep Agents Code quickstart](../../../docs/get-started/quickstart-langchain-deepagents-code.mdx)
harness (`NEMOCLAW_AGENT=langchain-deepagents-code`, `nemo-deepagents`, in-sandbox
`dcode` / `dcode -n`). This recipe's `AGENT_NAME` is the short alias **`deepagents`**,
not `langchain-deepagents-code`. There is no gateway and nothing to keep attached:
`run-agent-sandbox.sh` refuses this agent. Official NemoClaw docs cover vLLM and NIM
for Deep Agents, not Ollama. Install (or reinstall) the GPU chart with `INFERENCE_RUNTIME=vllm`
or `nim` before this loop; do not leave the chart on the Ollama default.

```bash
source versions.env
export AGENT_NAME=deepagents
export INFERENCE_RUNTIME=vllm
export INFERENCE_MODEL=nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-4B-FP8
export AGENT_SANDBOX_IMAGE=localhost:32000/nemoclaw-${AGENT_NAME}-k8s:${NEMOCLAW_VERSION}
./scripts/install-hpa.sh   # skip if the release is already on this runtime and model
./scripts/build-agent-sandbox-image.sh
./scripts/create-agent-sandbox.sh
./scripts/verify-agent-sandbox.sh   # real headless prompt through dcode -n
./scripts/run-agent-prompt.sh "Explain this repository in one sentence."
```

Interactive TUI (TTY), equivalent to `nemo-deepagents … connect` then `dcode`:

```bash
openshell sandbox exec -n deepagents-onprem -- dcode
```

One-script path for this example: [`scripts/test-deepagents-vllm.sh`](scripts/test-deepagents-vllm.sh).

## Env vars

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `AGENT_NAME` | — (required) | `openclaw`, `hermes`, or `deepagents` — selects everything else in this table |
| `AGENT_SANDBOX_IMAGE` | — (required) | Pushed image reference for the selected agent |
| `AGENT_SANDBOX_NAME` | See [Comparison](#comparison) | OpenShell sandbox name |
| `OPENSHELL_PROVIDER_NAME` | See [Comparison](#comparison) | OpenShell inference provider name |
| `AGENT_SANDBOX_CPU` / `AGENT_SANDBOX_MEMORY` | `2` / `4Gi` | Sandbox pod requests |
| `NEMOCLAW_TARGET_NODE` | unset (portable) | Pin the sandbox to a specific node |
| `VERIFY_HEALTH_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `90` | Plugin/version checks and OpenClaw/Hermes gateway readiness timeout |
| `VERIFY_SMOKE_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `30` | `verify-agent-sandbox.sh` timeout for the Hermes/Deep Agents Code config-file existence checks and Deep Agents Code's `dcode --version` |
| `VERIFY_CURL_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `120` | `verify-agent-sandbox.sh` timeout for the `/v1/models` GET (network-routing check only, all three agents) |
| `VERIFY_OPENCLAW_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `120` | Timeout for OpenClaw's real `openclaw agent --agent main -m "<prompt>"` call |
| `VERIFY_HERMES_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `120` | `verify-agent-sandbox.sh` timeout for Hermes's real `hermes -z "<prompt>"` call |
| `VERIFY_DCODE_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `120` | `verify-agent-sandbox.sh` timeout for Deep Agents Code's real `dcode -n "<prompt>"` call |

## Example verify output

All three agents follow the same shape: CLI/config checks, gateway health for
OpenClaw/Hermes, a `/v1/models` GET that proves the sandbox's inference route is
reachable, and finally a **real prompt through that agent's own
headless CLI** — never a curl straight to `/v1/chat/completions` — so a pass actually
proves the agent itself can answer, not just that the network path exists.

## Sandbox policies

- Each agent uses its official NemoClaw OpenShell policy.
- This on-premises recipe removes the default `integrate.api.nvidia.com` access from
  the OpenClaw and Hermes policies.
- The Deep Agents Code policy does not grant access to that endpoint.

## Notes

- `verify-agent-sandbox.sh` runs a real prompt through each agent's own headless CLI —
  `openclaw agent --agent main -m "<prompt>"`,
  `hermes -z "<prompt>"`, or `dcode -n "<prompt>"` — never a curl straight to
  `https://inference.local/v1/chat/completions`. The earlier `/v1/models` GET already
  proves network reachability; verification also rejects all known OpenClaw
  embedded-fallback markers so a broken gateway cannot produce a false pass.
- Hermes forwards two ports inside the sandbox per its manifest: the dashboard on `18789`
  and the OpenAI-compatible API on `8642`. Neither is exposed by `create-agent-sandbox.sh`
  today — reaching the
  dashboard from outside the sandbox would need its own `kubectl port-forward` to the
  sandbox pod, which this recipe has not set up or validated. `create-agent-sandbox.sh`
  checks the generated config while the sandbox is idle. Start `run-agent-sandbox.sh`
  before verification; verification then requires the `:8642/health` endpoint.
- Deep Agents Code (`dcode`) has no dashboard, no gateway process, and no port to forward —
  it runs, answers, and exits for every invocation. There is nothing for the HPA/monitoring
  stack to distinguish as "the agent is up" beyond the sandbox pod itself being Ready.
- Deep Agents Code's upstream policy grants broader default network access than
  OpenClaw/Hermes (`github.com` / `api.github.com` read-write, `raw.githubusercontent.com`
  read-only) since it's a coding agent — review it if that's not desired for your
  environment. Its `landlock.compatibility: strict` (vs. `best_effort` for OpenClaw/Hermes)
  also means sandbox creation fails closed rather than silently degrading if the
  kernel/workspace mount cannot enforce the declared read-only paths.
- OpenShell `0.0.85` leaves sandboxes idle (`sleep infinity`); `run-agent-sandbox.sh`
  execs the agent's entrypoint in the foreground and must stay attached — it does not
  auto-restart. Combined topology (privilege drop + agent-specific tooling) may require
  capabilities like `SYS_ADMIN` / `NET_ADMIN` in a restrictive admission policy — check your
  cluster's Pod Security admission before assuming a clean create.
- Official NemoClaw local providers for Deep Agents Code are vLLM and NIM, not Ollama.
  This recipe does not document `AGENT_NAME=deepagents` with `INFERENCE_RUNTIME=ollama`.
  `agent_common_validate_runtime_pairing` refuses that pairing in the three pairing
  scripts, `install-hpa.sh` (when `AGENT_NAME` is set), and the sandbox
  build/create/verify/prompt scripts.
